### Welcome to the wiki page of XVIS Tool

Hey there, this is the home page of the XVis tool's wiki. If you are looking for a specfic section, you can scoll down to find the table of contents or use the side navigation bar on the right.

## Brief Description

From the readme:

>This project aims to help explain how a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) makes its decision by visualizing the Class Activation Heatmap(CAM) of its hidden layers and the activations of each individual filter within that layer.  

To explain further:

In this project, we have created a few utility classes that together, allow for the visualisation of the CAMs and activations in the layers of a CNN. Using the utility classes in the project, it is possible to apply this visualisation to almost any keras model, given that the model is already trained.
