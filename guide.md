# Guide 

This section will mainly focus on giving a more high level and general explaination of the code. This section will also try and give a more general explaination of the concepts behind the code(although I make no promises I can explain it well).  

Here is a more detailed general layout of the code:

In words, the code will initialise all the variables you need and start with some default values, such as which layer is selected. As you move on, and change these variables, such as the selected layer, the activation and heatmap are computed again and shown in the drawer class.
